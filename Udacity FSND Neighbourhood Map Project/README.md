# Mumbai Neighborhood Map Project ðŸš‹

![Part of the Udacity Full Stack Web Development Nanodegree]

Developed for Project 10-3 of the **Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree**. 

This is the **Udacity Neighborhood Map Project**. It's intended as a challenge to put together a website from various APIs. This includes Google Maps and other location-based services like Foursquare. 

The app allows you to filter the list down as you type. In return, it displays the locations on the map. There's also extra info pulled from Foursquare where available. This includes websites and phone numbers.

The app is responsive, too! It resizes using CSS Flexbox and media queries. It can recalibrate itself based on your screen size -- try resizing the window!
